SPEED_VARIANCE = f"""Displays the speed deviation of the fastest laps within a {gt7helper.DEFAULT_FASTEST_LAPS_PERCENT_THRESHOLD * 100}% time difference threshold of the fastest lap.
Replay laps are ignored. The speed deviation is calculated as the standard deviation between these fastest laps.

With a perfect driver in an ideal world, this line would be flat. In a real world situation, you will get an almost flat line, 
with bumps at the corners and long straights. This is where even your best laps deviate.

You may get some insights for improvement on your consistency if you look at the points of the track where this line is bumpy.

The list on the right hand side shows your best laps that are token into consideration for the speed variance.

The checkbox 'Record Replays' will allow you to record replays. Be careful since also background action before and after a time trial is counted as a replay. This is when a car drives on the track in the background of the menu.

In the 'Best Lap' dropdown list you can select the reference lap. Usually this will point to the best lap of the session.

Fuel Consumed is the amount of fuel consumed in the lap.

What follows know are simple metrics for the characteristics of the lap. This is counted as ticks, which means instances when the game reported a state. For example Full Throttle = 500 means that you were on full throttle during 500 instances when the game sent its telemetry.
The same goes for Full Break, Coast and Tire Spin. Use this to easily compare your laps.
